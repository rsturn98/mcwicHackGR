Version 1.0: Chrome extension with search bar and slideshow of characters from a show (e.g. Brooklyn 99) with hyperlink to each actor's IMDB page [prototype/proof of concept]

The purpose of our project was to create a chrome extension that enhances your experience with tv shows and movies. Have you ever had a time where you recognize a voice or a face of character but can't recall where you might have seen/hear them before? This extension's purpose was to use your Netflix viewing history to answer this query. It would give you a list of the actors' works in order of relevance to the client and then based on popularity.

To see our prototype in action, download this repo and go to chrome://extensions, switch to developer mode, click 'Load unpacked' and select the folder.
